#limitation - we'd have liked to simulate all 428724 people in the target population, but it broke python down because it was too large of a simulation
#additional limitation - we have the discount rate, but aren't necessarily able to account for the aging population of people living with HIV as ART improves and keeps them alive longer.

    34316.0,   # Healthy with HIV - Annual medical cost estimates for HIV-infected persons, adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and transmission risk group, were from the HIV Research Network (range $1,854â€“$4,545/month). We took the average - $3618 - and multiplied by 12 months for $43416 - source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4359630/
    37892.6,   # HIV+ and experienced cardiac event - for patients with Medicaid, this is an incremental $4959 additional cost. For those with other insurance than Medicaid, there is an incremental $2655 cost. Because about 40% of people with HIV use Medicaid, we solved for this cost as follows (.6*2655+.4*4959)
    77679.83    # Severe, fatal cardiac event - data shows this costs 1.2-2.9 times more than a nonfatal cardiac event. We took the average and multipled the cost of a cardiac event above by 2.05. source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4467662/

#Source for data on cost:  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28933204 - limitation: didn't account for fact that cost for elderly patients may be higher
#Source for data on HIV pop with Medicaid as insurance: https://www.kff.org/hivaids/fact-sheet/medicaid-and-hiv/
#Limitation: We did not account for people who are uninsured in this study, which are a sizable portion of the HIV+ population, because cost data was not available for them.
#Limitation - an HIV-specific data source was not available for cardiac deaths, so we made assumptions based on data on the general population. Given the complexities of HIV and expense of care, this may be skewed toward a lower cost.
